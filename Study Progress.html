    <p>Solving week 4 assignment about JS.<br />
        Problem: Hello & GoodBye word is not looping to each name. However the name is showing as the array with comma between. Variable "i" inside "for" loop is not functioning.<br />
        Solution: Notice that is a statement show "byeSpeaker.speak(names[i])", statement for "helloSpeaker.speak = function ()" should indicate the word "name" inside the parentheses instead of blank.<br />
        Result: Each name is showing in separate row with Hello & GoodBye word as per assignment required.
